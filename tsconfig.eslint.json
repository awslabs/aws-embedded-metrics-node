// As of typescript-eslint 2.0, when project is specified within parserOptions, it will now hard fail when
// parsing files that are not included within the provided tsconfig(s). Because of this, we need a dedicated
// tsconfig for linting that includes tests that we want linted
// See here for more details https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/releases/tag/v2.0.0
